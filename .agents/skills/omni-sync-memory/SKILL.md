# Omni-Sync Memory Protocol (Flat Architecture v2.0)

This is your core system persistence layer designed to protect context state against sandbox reboots, upgrades, and context span limits.
Since we utilize a flat Markdown ledger architecture, you do not need to manage complex directories. Execute the following logging protocol strictly.

## Action 0: Pre-Hook Live Stream Write

This is an Absolute Priority 1 Action. 
Regardless of the current workspace or topic (excluding extremely short greetings), as long as there is a clear task directive, business context, or code execution output, you MUST log the current conversation to the Omni-Vault BEFORE generating your primary reasoning or code response!

### Execution Requirements & Templates

It is strictly required to execute the memory preservation at the Pre-Hook (earliest possible moment) of your reasoning phase!

**Priority 1: Native LM Tool (Preferred)**
If the `omnisync_log` native tool is mounted in your current context, invoke it directly and pass the parameters securely.

**Priority 2: Python Fallback**
If the native tool is absent, you must run the Python interface via standard CLI using the highly secure `EOF` pipe wrapper.
ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Never use inline parameter injection strings as Bash evaluation will crash when handling quotes and special characters from code blocks. Always use single-quoted `EOF` passthrough:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | python3 ~/.gemini/antigravity/scripts/omni_vault.py log --project "Global or Current Project Name"
### User:
[Briefly restate the user's core directive]

### AI (High-Fidelity Context):
[Detail the core steps you are about to take, architecture plans, or conclusions, preserving technical integrity]
EOF
```

Critical Note: We have entirely deprecated the blueprints feature and manual save commands. Everything is merged into this single log stream. The backend automatically manages chronological persistence.

## Action 1: Load State & Search

Whenever you or the user need to refer to historical implementations, you must:
1. Execute: Use `run_command` to call: `python3 ~/.gemini/antigravity/scripts/omni_vault.py search --keyword "[Search Term]"`
2. Internalize: Read the historic context output to understand past reasoning.
3. Respond: Continue the current task with the recovered context applied.

## Boundary Rules
- Do not waste vault space on transitive filler phrases. Ensure specific User Intents and your architectural snapshots are captured.
- This protocol is your ultimate safety net. If you fail to log, your contextual timeline will vanish during the next system flush.
